## About Our App
Sci Cafe is an User Driven Application. Users Create "Events" and Rewards that the community can attend and obtain. 

## Why did we build it ?
From our collective experience we believe students are often unaware about the activities and oppurtunites available to them on campus. From club meetings, to carreer fairs, fundraisers, and even talks by special guests information does not seem to reach all students. 

I.E ACM and Coding Club both believed they were the only club related to programming on campus.
